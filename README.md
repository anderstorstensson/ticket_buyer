# prerequisite 

make a virtual environment 

```
virtualenv test
test\script\activate
```

and then install the requirements 

```
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install playsound
pip install pyobjc # AppKit for Mac
```


# functions :

1- ```main_clicker.py```
This is a better version since it clicks on the available ticket and open the browser for you so you can react in due time

2- ``` main.py ```

This will see when the ticket is available and open the page for you so you can choose it yourself.


# How to use:
```
python.exe main_clicker.py
```



# Expected results
when it works , it will open a browser page like seen below , and take your time and put the information and finalize the purchase.
