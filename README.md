virtualenv test
test\script\activate
```

and then install the requirements

This will see when the ticket is available and open the page for you so you can choose it yourself.

```
python.exe main_clicker.py

when it works , it will open a browser page like seen below , and take your time and put the information and finalize the purchase.
